I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California Berkeley. As a political psychologist, my research interests include learning, attitude formation, and intuition. I am broadly interested in the role of automatic processes in the development of political knowledge and the formation and expression of political attitudes. My dissertation project examines the role of associational learning and memory in political thought. 

Other ongoing work involves the role of place and social context, the features and predictors of strong political attitudes, and the development of survey experimental methods for addressing questions of interest to political science. 

My teaching interests involve research methods, quantitative analysis, and causal inference, especially at the undergraduate level.
