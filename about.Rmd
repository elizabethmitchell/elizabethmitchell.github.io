Below are descriptions of my ongoing research projects, organized thematically. For a more concise list, please see [my CV](mitchellcv.pdf).

<b> Passive learning and associational knowledge </b>

What information can people learn about politics without trying? This line of inquiry uses the paradigm of associational learning to understand how people subconsciously build working models of the political world. 

<b> Attitude formation and change </b>

In this line of research, I investigate the causes and consequences of strong political attitudes. Building on Converse's black and white model, as well as more recent work in social psychology on attitude formation processes, I (in joint work with Casey Ste. Claire) propose a model of attitude strength as determined by features of the context, attitude object, and individual.

<b> Context, Place, and Geography </b>

I am interested in the role of social and physical context in political thought and behavior.

<b> Experimental methods </b>

My work in this area focuses on how to better construct survey experimental treatments and analyze survey experimental data.
