Below are descriptions of my ongoing research projects, organized thematically. For a list organized by paper, please see [my CV](mitchellcv.pdf).

<b> Name characteristics for survey experiments </b> (with Matthew Hayes)

This project presents a public dataset ( [available here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HEOSVW) ) of the perceived characteristics of more than 1000 common American first names. Survey experimenters using names to cue race or gender can use this data to select names that clearly signify a particular group membership without cuing other confounding attributes.



<b> Attitude formation and change </b> (with Casey Ste. Claire)

In this line of research, we investigate the causes and consequences of strong political attitudes. Building on Converse's black and white model, as well as more recent work in social psychology on attitude formation processes, we propose a model of attitude strength as jointly determined by features of the context, attitude object, and individual. Paper available upon request.

<b> Context, Place, and Geography </b>

I am interested in the role of social and physical context in political thought and behavior. In a working paper, I develop a concept of geographic identity, or the extent to which a place is a part of an individual's self-concept. A large survey (n=9,000) provides evidence that states with residents who are more attached to their state have higher levels of social capital. Paper available upon request.

<b> Psychological power and political participation </b>

This project explores the political implications of feeling powerful. Evidence from several large, high-quality surveys suggests that people who feel in control of what happens in their lives participate in politics at higher rates. Using panel data and survey experiments, I shed light on whether this relationship is causal.

<b> Passive learning and associational knowledge </b>

What information can people learn about politics without trying? This line of inquiry uses the paradigm of associational learning to understand how people subconsciously build working models of the political world. 


<b> Experimental methods </b>

My work in this area focuses on how to better construct survey experimental treatments and analyze survey experimental data.
